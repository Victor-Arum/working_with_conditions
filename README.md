# working_with_conditions
The data set belongs to a retail cosmetics store in USA with branches in cities of the country. Data set was gotten from Kaggle.com.
The aim of the project is to find out the optimum performance of each store, and daily deliverables.
At the end of the analysis, branches or cities that performed above optimum level with high sales were asked questions on how they were able to perform excellently well.
Lastly, the same work ethics from the high performing cities should be introduced into areas/cities that performed below the optimum level.
By doing this, upscaling the business in general is assured and would bring about improvement of sales in the business.
